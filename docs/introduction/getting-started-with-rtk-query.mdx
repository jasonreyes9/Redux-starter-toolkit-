# Getting Started with Redux Toolkit Query

## Purpose
**RTK Query** is provided as an optional addon within the `@reduxjs/toolkit` package. It is purpose-built to solve the use case of data fetching and caching, supplying a compact, but powerful toolset to define an API interface layer for your app. It is intended to simplify common cases for loading data in a web application, eliminating the need to hand-write data fetching & caching logic yourself.

RTK Query is built on top of the Redux Toolkit core for it's implementation, using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) internally for it's architecture. Although knowledge of Redux and RTK are not required to use RTK Query, you should explore all of the additional global store management capabilities they provide, as well as installing the [Redux DevTools browser extension](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools), which works flawlessly with RTK Query to traverse and replay a timeline of your request & cache behavior.

## Installation

As RTK Query is included within Redux Toolkit, the core package must be installed.

Redux Toolkit is available as a package on NPM for use with a module bundler or in a Node application:

```bash
# NPM
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit

# Yarn
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit
```

It is also available as a precompiled UMD package that defines a `window.RTK` global variable.
The UMD package can be used as a [`<script>` tag](https://unpkg.com/@reduxjs/toolkit/dist/redux-toolkit.umd.js) directly.

RTK Query is available via either of the two entry points below:

```ts no-transpile
import { createApi } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query'

/* React-specific entry point that automatically generates
   hooks corresponding to the defined endpoints */
import { createApi } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react'
```

## What's included
RTK Query includes these APIs:

- [`createApi()`](../api/rtk-query/createApi.mdx): The core of RTK Query's functionality. It allows you to define a set of endpoints describe how to retrieve data from a series of endpoints, including configuration of how to fetch and transform that data.
- [`fetchBaseQuery()`](../api/rtk-query/fetchBaseQuery.mdx): A small wrapper around [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) that aims to simply requests. Intended as the recommended `baseQuery` to be used in `createApi` for the majority of users.
- [`<ApiProvider />`](../api/rtk-query/ApiProvider.mdx): Can be used as a `Provider` if you **do not already have a Redux store**.
- [`setupListeners()`](../api/rtk-query/setupListeners.mdx): A utility used to enable `refetchOnMount` and `refetchOnReconnect` behaviors.
