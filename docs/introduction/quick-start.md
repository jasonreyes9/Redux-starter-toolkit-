# Quick Start

## Purpose

This is an experiment to create a generic api client based on (and potentially to be shipped with) redux toolkit that allows for effective querying of non-normalized api endpoints with some global caching & cache invalidation mechanisms.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit @rtk-incubator/simple-query
```
